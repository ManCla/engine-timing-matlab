# engine-timing-matlab

Just a wrapper of the [mathworks example](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/engine-timing-model-with-closed-loop-control.html) to be used with csv files for inputs and outputs.

## TODO

 * pass speed_setpoint and drag_torque_load as input to the matlab function to be called from python
